Project 1 of TDS
1. Explanation of Data Scraping
- Data was collected from the GitHub API, where I fetched information on users located in Stockholm with over 100 followers, including repository details, programming languages, follower count, and various repository features. Multiple API endpoints were utilized to capture both user-level and repository-level data comprehensively
2. Most Interesting Finding
- The language with the highest average stars per repository was RAML, which, despite being less mainstream, shows that languages focused on specific domains can attract high engagement, potentially due to a smaller but highly engaged community.
3. Actionable Recommendation for Developers
- For increased visibility and engagement, developers may consider enabling both projects and wiki on repositories, as repositories that enable these features tend to be more collaboratively developed and frequently starred.
